  <p><strong>During the survey, please follow these steps carefully:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Start with the left panel:</strong> Study the chart thoroughly, read the question carefully, and check the provided answer.</li>
    <li><strong>Next, move to the right panel:</strong> Read the detailed explanation provided, step-by-step, to see how the answer was derived.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate the answer and explanation:</strong> Consider whether the provided answer and its explanation clearly match your own interpretation of the chart.</li>
    <li><strong>Respond below:</strong> After reviewing everything, answer two questions at the bottom of the page to indicate whether the answer is correct and how clear both the answer and the explanation are.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> There are two questions (Q1 and Q2). The time from when you enter the page until you answer <strong>Q1</strong> will be recorded. The time spent on Q2 will not be recorded. <strong>Please answer Q1 first</strong> before proceeding to Q2.</p>
