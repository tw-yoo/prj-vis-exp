    <h1>Tutorial</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well participants understand and prefer different explanation methods for answers to chart-based questions. This tutorial is intended to help you understand the types of charts, questions, and explanations you will see during the survey, and to explain how the survey will proceed.</p>

    <p>You will be presented with a chart, a question related to that chart, the correct answer, and an explanation of the answer.</p>

    <p><strong>Chart:</strong> You will see either a bar chart or a line chart.</p>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> A question related to the displayed chart.</p>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> An explanation of the answer will be provided. Explanations may include text, images, or other elements.</p>

    <p>Please carefully review the chart, question, and explanation for each set before submitting your response.</p>
    <p>In this survey, we record the <strong>time spent</strong> for each round (explanation + response). This is used to analyze how long it takes you to understand and react to the explanations. The <strong>accuracy</strong> of your answers is most important, so please read quickly and respond <strong>intuitively</strong> rather than taking excessive time.</p>
