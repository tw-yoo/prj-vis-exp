  <h1>Tutorial</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the tutorial for our chart-based explanation study. This tutorial will guide you through what you will see and how to interact with each part of the survey.</p>

  <p>In each round, you will encounter:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chart:</strong> A bar chart or a line chart displaying data.</li>
    <li><strong>Question:</strong> A question asking you to interpret the chart.</li>
    <li><strong>Answer:</strong> The correct answer to the question.</li>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> A detailed explanation of why the answer is correct, which may include text and visual elements.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will record:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Time Spent:</strong> How long you take to read the explanation and submit your answer.</li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Whether your answer matches the correct answer. Accuracy is most important, so please answer based on your intuitive understanding.</li>
