  <p>Welcome to the tutorial for our chart-based explanation study. This tutorial will guide you through what you will see and how to interact with each part of the survey.</p>

  <h2>Survey Procedure Overview</h2>
  <p>The survey will be conducted as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Four explanation methods</strong> will be randomly assigned to you in a unique order.</li>
    <li>For each explanation method, you will complete <strong>5 rounds</strong>. In each round, you will review a chart, question, provided answer, and explanation, then complete a short evaluation task.</li>
    <li>After completing all 5 rounds of each explanation method, you'll answer a brief questionnaire (both multiple-choice and open-ended) about your experience with that method. This step will repeat 4 times, once for each explanation method.</li>
    <li>Once you finish evaluating all four explanation methods, you will complete a final questionnaire comparing and ranking your preferences among the methods. This questionnaire will also include both multiple-choice and open-ended questions.</li>
    <li>After finishing the final survey, you will receive a completion code. Please send this code via email to <a href="mailto:twyoo@yonsei.ac.kr">twyoo@yonsei.ac.kr</a> to receive your participation reward.</li>
