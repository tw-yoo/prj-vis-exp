      </div>
      <div class="pane-body">
        <p>To answer the question, we need to analyze the provided dataset, which contains 'cases' and 'year' information. The question asks for the two years with the most cases from 2005 onwards and the sum of those cases.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Filter the Data:</strong> We first isolate the data points for the years 2005 and later.
            <ul>
              <li>2005: 184.211</li>
              <li>2006: 168.827</li>
              <li>2007: 174.935</li>
              <li>2008: 186.108</li>
              <li>2009: 223.809</li>
              <li>2010: 262.799</li>
              <li>2011: 297.551</li>
              <li>2012: 325.044</li>
              <li>2013: 344.23</li>
              <li>2014: 408.037</li>
              <li>2015: 456.216</li>
              <li>2016: 516.031</li>
              <li>2017: 533.909</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identify the Top Two Years:</strong> By examining the 'cases' values for this filtered period, we can identify the two highest values.
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 40px;">
              <li>The highest number of cases is <strong>533.909</strong>, which occurred in the year <strong>2017</strong>.</li>
              <li>The second-highest number of cases is <strong>516.031</strong>, which occurred in the year <strong>2016</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Calculate the Sum:</strong> Finally, we sum the 'cases' for these two years.
            <p class="calculation">
              Sum = 533.909 (from 2017) + 516.031 (from 2016) = <strong>1049.94</strong>.
