    <h1>Thank you for your interest in our research!</h1>

    <p>This study investigates how different <strong>system-generated explanations</strong> for chart-based questions affect users’ understanding. You will be shown four distinct outputs generated by our system (labeled “Output 1” through “Output 4”) in a random order. After reviewing each output, please answer the accompanying questions and provide your feedback.</p>

    <p><strong>Survey Procedure:</strong> (1) Tutorial → (2) Main Survey → (3) Completion Code & Reward</p>

    <p>The main survey will be conducted as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Four types of system-generated explanations</strong> will be randomly assigned to you in a unique order. Here, an “explanation” refers to the reasoning process showing how the provided answer to a chart-based question was derived.</li>
        <li>For each type of system-generated output, you will complete <strong>5 rounds</strong>. In each round, you will review a chart, a question, the provided answer, and the system’s output, then complete a short evaluation task.</li>
        <li>After completing all 5 rounds for a type of system-generated output, you'll answer a brief questionnaire about your experience with that output. This step will <strong>repeat 4 times</strong>, once for each type of system-generated output.</li>
        <li>After you have evaluated all four types of system-generated output, you will complete a final questionnaire. In this questionnaire, you will compare and rank your preferences among the outputs, and provide any additional feedback.</li>
        <li>After finishing the final survey, you will receive a completion code along with the contact email address. Please send this code to that email to receive your participation reward.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We will record:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time Spent:</strong> How long you take to read the system’s output and submit your answers.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Responses:</strong> Your judgments and feedback about the system-generated output.</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Whether your answer matches the correct answer. Accuracy matters most, so please answer based on your best understanding.</li>
    </ul>
