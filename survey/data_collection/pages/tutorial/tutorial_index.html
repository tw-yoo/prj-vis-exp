        <p>Thank you so much for your interest in our study. In this study, you will create compositional questions about charts. This tutorial will help you understand what operations are available and how to use them.</p>

    <h2>What is a Compositional Question?</h2>
    <p>A compositional chart question is a question that requires <strong>more than one step</strong> to answer. Instead of looking at a single value in the chart, you combine two or more pieces of information to figure out the result. Your task is to create compositional questions about the given chart.</p>

            <h3>Compositional question examples:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the difference between the total number of sunny days in (June, July, August) and the total number of sunny days in (December, January, February)?
                    <li>Which month has the second highest combined number of foggy and rainy days?
                    <li>What is the difference between the average number of sunny days in the first quarter (January–March) and the average number of sunny days in the last quarter (October–December)?
                </ul>
            <h3>Questions that are <strong>not</strong> compositional questions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What month has the lowest count?
                    <li>What is the maximum count value?
                    <li>What month has the most sunny days?
                </ul>
