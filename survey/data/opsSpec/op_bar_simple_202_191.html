    <p>First, sort the data by the 'Votes' column in descending order. Identify the top three vote values: 164376, 143843, and 76605. Calculate their average by summing these values to get 384824 and dividing by 3, which results in 128274.67. Next, identify the bottom three vote values: 62770, 51595, and 18638. Calculate their average by summing these values to get 133003 and dividing by 3, which results in 44334.33. Finally, subtract the average of the lowest three votes from the average of the highest three votes: 128274.67 minus 44334.33 equals 83940.33.</p>
