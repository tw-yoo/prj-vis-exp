    <p>First, calculate the year-over-year change in Gross Domestic Product by subtracting the previous year's value from the current year's value. The change from 1980 to 1985 is -1314, from 1985 to 1990 is -1122, from 1990 to 1995 is 2786, from 1995 to 2000 is 3456, and from 2000 to 2005 is 10213. Next, identify all positive year-over-year changes, which are 2786, 3456, and 10213. Sum these values to get 16455. Then, identify all negative year-over-year changes, which are -1314 and -1122. Take the absolute value of each negative change, resulting in 1314 and 1122. Sum these absolute values to get 2436. Finally, compare the sum of positive changes (16455) with the absolute sum of negative changes (2436) to see if 16455 is greater than 2436.</p>
