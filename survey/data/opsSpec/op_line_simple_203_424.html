    <p>First, sort the 'Winnings' column in descending order. The largest value is 602395 and the 4th largest value is 270000. Calculate the ratio by dividing 602395 by 205937, which gives approximately 2.92. (Self-correction: The 4th largest value is 205937 based on re-sorting the original data. The initial walkthrough incorrectly picked 270000. Let's re-verify the values and recompute). Let's re-sort: 602395, 482604, 336432, 205937, 170716, 166842, 152206, 128750, 110105, 90942, 86830, 83825, 72136, 71822, 45800, 42651, 39475, 27000, 20927, 16444, 7925, 4425, 975, 535. The largest is 602395. The 4th largest is 205937. The ratio is 602395 / 205937 = 2.9250. So the ratio is approximately 2.93.</p>
