    <p>First, filter the data to include only the 'Religious' groups Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh. For each of these groups, identify the 'Percentage' value for 'Work participation (%)' and 'Literacy (%)'. For the Hindu group, work participation is 40.40 and literacy is 65.10. For the Muslim group, work participation is 31.30 and literacy is 59.10. For the Sikh group, work participation is 37.70 and literacy is 69.40. Next, calculate the ratio of Work participation to Literacy for each group. For Hindu, the ratio is 40.40 divided by 65.10, which is approximately 0.6206. For Muslim, the ratio is 31.30 divided by 59.10, which is approximately 0.5296. For Sikh, the ratio is 37.70 divided by 69.40, which is approximately 0.5432. Finally, compare these ratios. The Hindu group has the highest ratio of approximately 0.6206.</p>
