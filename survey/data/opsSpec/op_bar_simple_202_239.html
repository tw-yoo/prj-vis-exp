    <p>First, filter the data to only include rows where the Type is "synthesis". Collect the Indices values for these rows: 2.56 for Swahili, 1.75 for spoken Turkish, 2.33 for written Turkish, 2.17 for Yakut, 1.82 for Greek, 1.67 for English, and 3.7 for Eskimo. Calculate the average of these seven values, which is 2.28. Next, filter the data to only include rows where the Type is "derivation". Collect the Indices values for these rows: 0.03 for Swahili, 0.06 for spoken Turkish, 0.11 for written Turkish, 0.16 for Yakut, 0.07 for Greek, 0.09 for English, and 0.34 for Eskimo. Calculate the average of these seven values, which is 0.12. Finally, compare the average synthesis value of 2.28 to the average derivation value of 0.12, noting that 2.28 is greater than 0.12.</p>
